# Owen Richards Personal Porfolio

## Why?

I started this project it connect with more people looking to connect either 
with potential project ideas to work on or job opportunities out of university. 
This project also forced me to learn new technologies, how to deploy a website and 
improve my abilities. The project refined my web development skills and will be useful 
in being a teachers assistant for courses.

## Technologies

This project had a plethora of technologies. Some of the technologies used in this project was:
JavaScript, HTML, CSS, JavaScript XML, Vanta.js, GSAP, SCSS, Framer-motion, react animations, Netlify (for deploying),
GoDaddy (domain name). Through doing this project I also learnt other technologies that we implimented in previous versions 
such as three.js. However, not all the technologies learnt in the project are illistrated in the **current** final project due 
to a various of reasons, one being webstie latency because of CPU power

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
